# DinoPod (v1.1 - rejected from the app store)

Written in Swift 2.0, Dinopod was made because I missed using the original iPod.  It allows you to play the same music in your Music App's Library in a UI based upon the original iPod.  You can change its casing color, trackwheel color, and button colors.

This app was made in 2015 with XCode 7.0 because of its swift 2.0 compiler.
